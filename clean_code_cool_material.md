## Katas

Katas are coding challenges meant to train certain aspects of software design
They are relatively short and some come with a starting point.

Many of them are meant to be repeated over and over, like their namesake Karate's Kata, where
you train a pattern of movements as if it was a simulated fight

  - Page is in German but exercises are available in English (click the flags)
  - Katas are divided by artifacts: functions, classes, library ...
